# Data Science Job Salaries Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and predicting data science job salaries based on various features. The dataset contains information on work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary, and other relevant attributes.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to explore the factors that influence data science job salaries and build a predictive model to estimate salaries based on different variables.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Understanding**: Initial exploration of the dataset's shape, data types, and available columns to gain insights into the data.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting categorical values into meaningful formats.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing salary distribution, measures of central tendency, variability, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between salary and various factors such as experience level, employment type, company size, job type, and more.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting hypothesis tests, including a Z-test, to validate findings and insights.

6. **Modeling**: Building a predictive model for salary estimation using Linear Regression. Comparing the model's performance with a Decision Tree Regressor.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing key findings, the best-performing model, and potential insights gained from the analysis.

## Key Insights

- The project begins by cleaning and preparing the dataset, including handling duplicates, missing values, and transforming categorical variables.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations provide insights into salary distribution, central tendency, variability, and correlations with different features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals trends in salary based on experience level, employment type, company size, job type, and location.
- Hypothesis testing helps validate findings and assess statistical significance.
- The project concludes with the selection of the best-performing model (Linear Regression) for predicting salaries.
